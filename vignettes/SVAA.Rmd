While similar - and at this point more comprehensive - packages have long existed and been established within the R community (namely [vars](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vars/vars.pdf)), SVAA is designed to...
This guide will not only take you through the core functionality of SVA, but also explain theory underlying the code. The part on SVARs (including the code) draws heavily on the text book [Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/lkilian2019/textbook) by Lutz Kilian and Helmut Luethkepohl.
